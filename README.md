# JobMarket-Profiles-Analysis
This project focuses on data engineering, processing, and analysis of professional profile data in the maintenance and reliability field. The goal is to extract trends, categorize profiles for market segmentation, and generate actionable insights using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

During development, data was extracted from professional profiles using the Apify platform. All subsequent tasks, including processing, analysis, and insights generation, were performed on this data.

Note: The dataset used during development contains private profile information collected during an internship and is not included due to privacy and confidentiality reasons. You can run the code using your own dataset with a similar structure.
